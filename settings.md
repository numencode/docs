you want by clicking the **Add new** button. At least one language is required for the website to work.

#####Locale

#####Order
The sort order, expressed by the number, eg. *10*.

#####Is default?
Default language in which the website opens on first visit. Only one language can be default and if you mark this
checkbox, any other language that was set as default will be un-selected.

#####Is hidden?
When checked, the language will be disabled and hidden on the websites' language selection.
